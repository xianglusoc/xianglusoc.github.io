## About
Hi! My name is Xiang Lu (吕想). I am an Assistant Professor at Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences (IAS) and the Department of Sociology, Zhejiang University. Before joining ZJU, I received a PhD in Sociology from New York University.

My research interests lie in race and ethnicity, migration studies, and sociology of family. Below are some topics that I am particularly interested in:

- Racial/ethnic conceptualization from historical and comparative perspectives
- Migrants’ ethnic identity formation and social integration
- Identity of multiethnic people
- Mating and reproductive behaviors
