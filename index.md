## About
Hi! My name is Xiang Lu (吕想). I am an Assistant Professor at Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences (IAS) and the Department of Sociology, Zhejiang University. Before joining ZJU, I received a PhD in Sociology from New York University.

My research interests lie in race and ethnicity and migration. I am currently writing a book that examines the intricate dynamics by which China's Hui Muslim internal migrants utilize their unique Sino-Muslim bi-cultural identity to participate in China-Arab trade. This work illuminates how they maneuver through a landscape rife with ethnic advantages and challenges, undergoing cultural adaptation and negotiation, while perpetually reshaping their identity in their interactions with the Han majority and the wider Muslim world.

Apart from this book project, I have also been broadly interested in topics such as:

- Racial/ethnic conceptualization from historical and comparative perspectives
- Migrants’ ethnic identity formation and social integration
- Identity of multiethnic people
