## About
Hi! My name is Xiang Lu (吕想). I am a tenure-track Distinguished Associate Research Fellow (特聘副研究员) at Center for Study on Nation and Ethnicity, [Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences (IAS)](http://www.iash.zju.edu.cn/topic/home), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn). I also teach and supervise students at the [Department of Sociology](http://sociology.zju.edu.cn). 

My research interests lie in race and ethnicity and migration studies. Specifically, I am interested in:

- Racial/ethnic conceptualization from a historical and comparative perspective
- Migrants’ ethnic identity formation and social integration
- Identity of multiethnic people
